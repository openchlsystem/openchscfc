**Charting Library**:

2. [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for creating real-time dashboards.

3. **Backend (Processing and Storage)**  
   * **Technologies**: Django with REST API for data management.  
   * **Speech-to-Text**: Use cloud APIs like Google Speech-to-Text or Whisper for transcription.  
   * **Language Translation**: Leverage cloud translation services (e.g., DeepL, Google Translate).  
   * **Triage System**: Python-based AI/ML models for sentiment and keyword analysis.  
4. **Database**  
   * Store text/audio data, translations, and case statuses.  
   * **Schema**:  
     * Complaints: `id`, `text`, `audio_url`, `language`, `priority`, `status`.  
     * Metrics: `submission_time`, `response_time`, `resolution_time`.  
5. **AI Integration**  
   * **Triage Engine**:  
     * Use pre-trained sentiment analysis models or custom models to predict case severity.  
   * **Translation**:  
     * Automatically translate incoming complaints into the platformâ€™s primary working language.  
   * **Analytics**:  
     * Generate visual reports using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.

     * Metrics dashboard.  
     * Tools for responding to and resolving complaints.

---

### **System Workflow**

1. **Complaint Submission**  
   * Child opens the platform and selects the desired input method (text/audio).  
   * Audio is recorded and transcribed into text automatically.  
   * Translations are performed if needed.  
2. **Processing**  
   * Complaint data is saved to the database.  
   * AI analyzes the complaint for severity and routes it to the relevant department.  
3. **Case Handling**  
   * Caseworkers view complaints in a priority queue.  
   * Responses or follow-ups are logged in the system.  
4. **Feedback and Closure**  
   * Children receive updates on their case status.  
   * System requests optional feedback after the case is closed.

---

### **Example UI Components**

1. **Homepage**  
   * â€œHow can we help you?â€  
   * Options:  
     * Speak your problem (Microphone icon).  
     * Write your problem (Keyboard icon).  
     * Upload a drawing or image.  
2. **Complaint Form**  
   * **Step 1**: Choose Input Method (Text/Audio).  
   * **Step 2**: Enter or Record Your Complaint.  
   * **Step 3**: Select Language (if applicable).  
   * **Step 4**: Confirm Submission.  
3. **Metrics Dashboard**  
   * **Widgets**:  
     * Total Complaints Submitted.  
     * Average Response Time.  
     * Cases by Category (e.g., abuse, education).  
     * Cases by Language.

---

### **Technical Considerations**

1. **Scalability**  
   * Use cloud services for speech-to-text and translation to handle large-scale processing.  
2. **Offline Support**  
   * Allow complaint drafts to be saved locally if the user has intermittent connectivity.  
3. **Legal Compliance**  
   * Adhere to child protection and privacy laws (e.g., COPPA, GDPR).  
4. **Future Enhancements**  
   * Chatbot integration for basic FAQs.  
   * Gamified reporting process (e.g., â€œHelp us help others\!â€).  
   * AI-assisted follow-up messages to keep children informed.
